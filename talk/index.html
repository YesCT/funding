                <ul><li>Direct funding between individual contributors and individual companies
                  <ul>
                    <li>long term support - Cathy at Compress - blog and work on issues.
                    <li>short term topical contract limited in scope - Acquia sponsorship of Berdir and Alex to complete CMI dependencies
                  </ul>
                  <li>Companies hiring core contributors on staff - Acquia, Chapter3 and Black Mesh
                  <li>Consistent but crowdsourced funding (Gittip) - alexpott, patrickd
                  <li>Project funding gateway (drupalfund.us) - D8 rules module
                  <li>% time given by companies to their employees
                  <li>Individual who fund themselves by charging more for their work or spending their free time. For example, Jennifer Hodgdon.
                  <li>Event sponsorship, Drupalcon scholarships, DA Partners - but this is indirect and unreliable</li>

              <h1>Do we really have a problem?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Community concerns about current strategies</li>
                <li>It's all on the individual or companies</li>
                <li>There's no bucket</li>
                <li>Repercussions on individuals, groups, and Core itself</li>
              </ul>
              <aside class="notes">
                The community has some concerns about how and who is paid to work on core. These concerns vary, for example:
                <ul>
                  <li>a general distrust of any centralising force within the Drupal community</li>
                  <li>perceived conflicts of interest between an employer and what's best for Drupal</li>
                  <li>contributions of paid core developers drowning out the hobbyists & voluntary efforts</li>
                  <li>the needs of the enterprise might trump those of the individual and small sites</li>
                  <li>that the scale of money involved redefines the notion of "free"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a user or an individual has money to give they have nowhere officially supported by the community</p>
                <p>External, expected rewards diminish the intrinsic motivation of the fundraising open-source contributor. It risks transporting a community of peers into a transactional terminal. And that buyer-seller frame detracts from the magic that is peer-collaborators.</p>

              <h1>Are there solutions?</h1>

              <aside class="notes">
                <p>Drupal.org needs recognition for individuals, agencies and end users for variety of types of contributions to Drupal. (not just patch credit).</p>

                <p>Central independent organization whose goal is to ensure the continued existence and success of the drupal project via funding core contributions that advance the directives decided by initiatives endorsed by dries.

                <p>We've tried gittip its not working talked with founder about problems of the platform. reason failing, no dedicated skilled fundraisers. Not integrated into d.o.

                <p>Change the ways people are dedicating resources, not give more.
